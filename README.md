# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
In our project, we intend to use IoT to produce an analogy of smart advertisements. The overall purpose of this project is to extract some valuable and useful information from a social media user’s bulk data. An analytical approach has been used in this project that can further serve as a basis for decision making as well as analyzing trends. The primary platform used for this project is Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the runtime Python Python. On the other hand for visualization the platforms used are Data Studio, Node-red, and Blynk app. Currently, the project is a kind of prototype application that fetches the liked pages from the user’s profile and then analyses the main categories of the liked pages as per their fan counts.
